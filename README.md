# Readable

Readable is a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the frontend code and the code for the Readable API backend server as it was provided in the starter project.

## Installing

This project was bootstrapped with **Create React App**. To install the app, do the following:
* Start the Readable API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install the frontend code and launch the development server:
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## Notes

The app relies on the `semantic-ui-react` and `semantic-ui-css` for styling. It also includes the `redux-logger` package to log redux state changes.
