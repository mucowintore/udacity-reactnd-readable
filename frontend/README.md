# Readable

Readable is a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the frontend

# Installing

This project was bootstrapped with **Create React App**. To install the app, do the following:

* In another terminal window, install the frontend and start the frontend development server
    - Go to the `frontend` directory
    - `npm install`

# Notes

The app relies on the `semantic-ui-react` and `semantic-ui-css` for styling. It also includes the `redux-logger` package to log redux state changes.
